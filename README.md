## üìä Example Highlight ‚Äì Chest X-Ray Classification
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUROC |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Logistic Regression | **95.1%** | **96.3%** | **97.0%** | **96.7%** | **0.983** |
| Decision Tree       | 90.7%    | 93.1%    | 94.2% | 93.6%   | 0.814 |
| Random Forest       | 93.7%    | 95.5%    | 95.9% | 95.7%   | 0.977 |

‚úÖ Logistic Regression surprisingly outperformed tree-based models in this task.
